Solves N Queens with backtracking


This is a basic NQueens solving program.

It was done in C# and has a pretty basic algorithm behind it.
NQueens is a backtracking process in which we check if a queen kills another queen by going left to right, up and down and diagonally.

Anyone is free to use this code, but know there might be a few bugs, and there are a lot of optimizations you can do to it.

I would like to make the backtrackking algorithm in to a background process (background worker) to allow for a faster program and to be able
to do multiple things at once.
